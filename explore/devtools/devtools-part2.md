Please take a look at expand/screenshots for relevant screenshots for this task.

1. The values num1 and num2 were initially strings and not integers, and therefore there was a bug that arose. Hence, when we added them, instead of actually adding num1 and num2, num1 and num2 were being concatenated.

2. In order to fix this bug, I used the parseInt function to parse the relevant string inputs into integers. Please take a look at expand/screenshots/fix.png
